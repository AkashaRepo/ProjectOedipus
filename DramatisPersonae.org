*** Hero of the past (in the future)
The Hero of this play may or may not be played by myself (Nathaniel Sheppard), he is the last soldier of the North American Technocracy (NAT), a government which exists in a parallel timeline that may or may not come into existence because of the events in this play.

This soldier from the future, is fighting a war in space against machines called the TITANS. As the war escalates, it starts to spread into time itself, as weapons capable of sending information into the past to change the present are introduced. At the start of the play, the Hero captures a Tachyon laser built by the TITANS and uses it to go back in time in hopes of changing this, becoming his own worst enemy in the process.

*** Heroine of the future (in the past)
The Heroine of this play is a female Shepherd (who may or may not be played by one of the many Stephanie living on Orcas) At the start of the play she hid in a cave because of an argument with her parents which will not be part of this play.
