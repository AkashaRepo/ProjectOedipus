# ProjectOedipus
A play in the Greek tradition with Sci-Fi elements, intended to be preformed on Orcas island in summer of 2018.

This is a play inspired partly by the Legend of Oedipus, particularly it's most famous telling by the Greek Playwright Sophocles. However, it includes more modern themes borrowed from science fiction and post-modern philosophy, such as time travel, Robot-revolts, Transhumanism, and non-linear narratives.
