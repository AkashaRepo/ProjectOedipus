ProjectOedipus
==============

A play in the Greek tradition with Sci-Fi elements, intended to be preformed on Orcas island in summer of 2018.

This is a play inspired partly by the Legend of Oedipus, particularly it's most famous telling by the Greek Playwright Sophocles. However, it includes more modern themes borrowed from science fiction and post-modern philosophy, such as time travel, Robot-revolts, Transhumanism, Information theroy, and non-linear narratives.

This play is written as software to run on the hardware of the village green in East Sound WA. However it is also intended to be open source software that can be run through any medium with minor addaptations. As such, it is packaged with the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, which should be stapled to every playbill. (maybe not, that would be a waste of paper, Better to just include a link to this repository)
