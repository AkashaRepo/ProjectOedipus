# ProjectOedipus
A play in the Greek tradition with Sci-Fi elements, intended to be preformed on Orcas island in summer of 2018.

Okay that worked, time to start writing for real. I might include some notes like this hidden between version changes, so anybody who's better at Git than I am will be able to find hidden messages.

This is a play inspired partly by the Legend of Oedipus, particularly it's most famous telling by the Greek Playwright Sophocles. However, it includes more modern themes borrowed from science fiction and post-modern philosophy, such as time travel, Robot-revolts, Transhumanism, and non-linear narratives.
