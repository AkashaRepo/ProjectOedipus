This play is intended to be preformed in front of a live audience of all ages, but also explores themes such as patricide and incest. This should be safe if I hide all the sex and violence offscreen and make use of innuendo instead of showing anything, but I still want to use some swears.

In the script, the word Motherfucker and other curses should appear several times. These may be censored in live performances depending on the audience. The spoken words that replace them are up to the actors and not the responsibility of the Playwright.
